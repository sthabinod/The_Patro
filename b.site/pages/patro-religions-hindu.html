							<h3 class="text-center" style="text-decoration: underline;" >Origin</h2>
				<p class="margin-30" style="text-align: justify;">It is believed that the <span style="font-style:italic";>Hinduism</span> was brought to India by the invaders of Indus Valley who settled along the banks of the Indus river known as Aryans.

There are artifacts which date to before 2000 BCE. Similarly, the word <span style="font-style:italic";>Hindu</span>, is derived from the name of the river Indus. The river was called <span style="font-style:italic";>Sindhu</span> in the ancient times. The pre-Islamic Persians who sailed and travelled to India called the river <span style="font-style:italic";>Hindu</span> and the land <span style="font-style:italic";>Hindustan</span>. The people living there were recognized as <span style="font-style:italic";>Hindus</span>.</p>
