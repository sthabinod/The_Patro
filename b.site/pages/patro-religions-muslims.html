				<h1 style="margin-top: 30px;" class="text-center underline-meaning">Islam</h1>
				<p class="margin-30" style="text-align: justify;">Islam is the second largest religion of the world after Christianity. The people following the Islam religion are most commonly known as Muslims. Almost, 1.8 billion population of the world are Muslims. Islam is the dominant religion in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Maldives and Sri-Lanka, Iraq, Iran, Malaysia, Egypt etc. The Islam is a monotheistic religion i.e. they believe that there is only one god. The Muslims worship the god Allah. Similarly, they also give high respect to Muhammad as he is believed to be the messenger of the god and also the founder of Islam. Allah is the supreme god and the creator. Allah is considered to be true, perfect and unique from every other being. It is unallowed to compare the great Allah with any other beings. Similarly, Muhammad is the person who lived and died. It is believed that he received direct verbal revelations from Gabriel, an archangel. With the verbal revelations, Quran the holy book was written.</p>

				<h2 class="text-center" style="text-decoration: underline;" >Origin</h2>
				<p class="margin-30" style="text-align: justify;">It is believed that the <span style="font-style:italic";>Islam</span> religion was originated at the start of the 7th century. Some Muslims argue that the Islam religion did not start from Muhammad, but it was the faith of the other prophets. One of the other prophet is believed to be <span style="font-style:italic";>Jesus</span>, the son of Mary. While Jesus is believed to be son of the God in Christianity, Muslims refer Jesus as the prophet who had faith in Allah. In the early 7th century, Muhammad started receiving direct divine relevations. With the messages, he then won hearts of many people making them the followers. The messages revealed to Muhammad was the basis on which <span style="font-style:italic";>Quran</span> was written. With his death, disagreement broke out between the followers over who would succeed him as the leader. Then, a person considered to be the political-religious successor to the Muhammad was selected as <span style="font-style:italic";>Caliph</span> to lead the Islam/Muslim community. The Caliph leaded the muslim followers and conquested vast areas of the Arabs and naming the territory as the <span style="font-style:italic";>Caliphates</span>. Then, the Caliphates invaded the South west Asia and also the South Asia in the following centuries. This resulted in the Muslim community growing bigger.</p>
				
				<h3 class="text-center" style="text-decoration: underline;">Deities (Gods & Goddesses)</h2>
				<p class="margin-30" style="text-align: justify;">
					As Islam is the monotheistic religion i.e. believing only one god, Allah is considered to be the only one and true god in the Islam religion. Muhammad the prophet is given high respect but is not considered god. As the Declaration of Faith of Islam religion states Muhammad is the last messenger and servant of the god. The declaration states that nothing other than god is divine or worthy to be worshipped.

                        <li style="margin-top: 5px;">Hajj: The Muslims shall visit  Mecca, the holiest city of Muslims at least once in their lifetime if they are capable financially.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

					<h3 class="text-center" style="text-decoration: underline;" >Festivals</h2>
				<p class="margin-30" style="text-align: justify;">There are 2 official holidays that are celebrated in the muslim religion. They are Eid Al-Fitr and Eid Al-Adha.
					<ul>
						<li style="text-align: justify;">Eid Al-Fitr: Eid Al-Fitr is celebrated in the last days of the Ramadan month. The muslim people fast from dawn-sunset for 29 or 30 days during the month of Ramadan. In the end, Eid Al-Fitr is celebrated which marks the end of the long fasting and the start of the feast. In some countries, feast lasts upto 3 days. Muslims believe that they are commanded by Allah to continue their fasting till the last day of Ramadan. It is the most important festival in the muslim calendar year. It is also known as the "Feast of Breaking the Fast" which also means the end of the Ramadan month.</li>
						<li style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 10px;">Eid Al-Adha: Eid Al-Adha is celebrated commemorating the sacrifice made by Ibrahim of his son to the god. The festival honors the obedience of Ibrahim towards Allah. It is considered to be the holier festival among the two festivals that are celebrated by the muslims. It is also known as "Eid Qurban" and "Festival of the Sacrifice".</li>
					</ul>
				</p>

				<h3 class="text-center" style="text-decoration: underline;" >Holy Books</h2>
				<p class="margin-30" style="text-align: justify;">The Quran is considered to be the holiest book by the Muslims. It contains the revelations that was received by the Muhammad from Allah directly. It is considered to be the sacred word of God “Allah”. Some believe that some person from the Muhammad followers wrote down the words of Muhammad. As Muhammad was illiterate i.e., he could not read or write. The books refer Allah as the first person talking to Muhammad through the archangel Gabriel.</p>
